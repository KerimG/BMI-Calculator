    <h2>BMI Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index" target="blank"
        >Body Mass Index</a
      >
      (<span style="font-style: italic">BMI</span> for short) is a value often
      used to determine a person's physical health by considering a person's
      weight in relation to height. By calculating and evaluating a BMI value,
      it can be determined whether a person is underweight, of normal weight,
      overweight, obese or extremely obese.
      <br />
      <br />
      According to
      <a
        href="https://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/bmi_text/en/"
        target="_blank"
        >World Health Organization</a
      >
      (<span style="font-style: italic">WHO</span>
      for short) millions on people die each year worldwide as a direct result
      of being overweight or obese. Body mass has a huge impact on a person's
      long term health which is why the BMI value is a relevant way to indicate
      a person's physical health.
      <br />
      <br />
      The BMI value should ideally be inbetween 18 and 24 as this spectrum
      suggests that a particular individual is of normal weight. This weight
      category is ideal because it comes with fewer health risks. A BMI below 18
      indicates a state of being underweight and above 24 is overweight if not
      obese or extremely obese as further descripted below.
      <br />
      <br />
      A BMI which is too height and therefore suggests that a person stores more
      mass than is optimal for someone of their height comes with various health
      risks such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High blood pressure</li>
      <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
      <li>Stroke</li>
      <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
    </ul>
